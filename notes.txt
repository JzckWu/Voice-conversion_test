poetry init           # Create pyproject.toml interactively
poetry add            # Add a dependency
poetry install        # Install dependencies & make a venv
poetry env activate (then copy paste output)  # Enter the virtual environment
poetry build          # Build package for distribution
poetry publish        # Publish to PyPI

sometimes need to switch the python interpreter

using Firebase Explorer extension:
cmd + shift + p and paste ext install jsayol.firebase-explorer

go through fishaudio inference file to download checkpoints etc

to run modules
python -m voice_initiation.voice_scrape


obscure notes:

poetry env info --path

switch from poetry to uv
